If you want a script to run when you boot into the LXDE environment, you could take a look at this Raspberry Pi forum post:

Navigate to ~/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi

Open the autostart file in that folder:

$ sudo nano autostart
Add @midori on a new line. If you want to run something like a python script, put something like @python mypython.py on a new line. Running a script file would be @./superscript, but for some reason the script runs in an infinite loop (perhaps this will stop that).

Save and exit: Ctrl+X, Y, Enter

Restart your Raspberry Pi into the LXDE environment.
